I contributed to the Art Science Studio by designing and creating AR Posters and an AR applicaiton.

The [**Art Science Studio**](https://pq.cz/pq-2023-info/projects-2023/student-exhibition-pq/germany-pov-pq/) is a collaborative studio bringing together five computer science students from TU Dresden with six theatre students from the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts (HfBK). The course was led by junior professors Theda Nilsson from HfBK Dresden and Matthew McGinity from TU Dresden.

To represent Germany at the student competition of the 15th edition of the [Prague Quadrennial of Performance, Design, and Space](https://pq.cz), we created a pavilion encapsulating elements of German culture - the garden houses adorned with garden gnomes and techno music.

The pavilion was exhibited in Prague during the Prague Quadrennial which took place from the 8th to the 18th of July.

Below is a selection of my contributions:

## AR Posters

I designed three posters using Figma and Blender that were exhibited on the exterior of the pavilion. To incorporate augmented reality functionality, an AR marker was integrated into each poster.
Since I did not possess any prior Blender experience and due to time constraints, the decision was made to create and modify Blender shapes based on online tutorials by [Ducky 3D](https://www.youtube.com/@TheDucky3D).

- The first poster features a dancing figure wearing a warning vest matching the vests worn in the pavilion. This poster is an instructional guide explaining how to use the AR markers on the posters and stamps.
- The second poster showcases a vibrant transforming flower, symbolizing the garden house ([Tutorial](https://youtu.be/nsqeZV9mKTc)).
- The third poster embraces a techno-inspired esthetic, reflecting the ambiance of the techno club at nighttime  ([Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrgusWbdEGY)).
